# JRPG

This is the Game made specifially for my Server-Project at https://github.com/Gandalf1783/JRPGGameServer/

Since this Project focuses on Multiplayer, the Singleplayer-Mode has been left behind.

Any help is appreciated. Create issues with proper Errors (if any in the Console) or report Bugs.

### Things to Work on:
  - Singleplayer World Generation
  - Proper Inventory Handling
